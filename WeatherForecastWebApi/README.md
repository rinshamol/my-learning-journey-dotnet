# Dotnet Learning Series

This repository contains my learning journey with .NET, starting from basic console applications and gradually exploring more advanced topics.  
Each folder or project in this series represents a new topic or concept I practiced while building real code examples.

## 📌 Project
This project demonstrates two approaches to building a Weather Forecast API in ASP.NET Core:
- Controller-based API – using [ApiController] and [HttpGet]/[HttpPost]/[HttpPut]/[HttpDelete]
- Minimal API – using MapGet() and record types for quick, lightweight endpoints
The API provides weather forecast data and basic CRUD operations.

## 🚀 How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
`git clone https://github.com/rinshamol/my-learning-journey-dotnet.git`
2. Navigate into the project:
`cd my-learning-journey-dotnet/WeatherForecastWebApi/`
4. Restore dependencies:
`dotnet restore`
5. Run the app:
`dotnet run`
